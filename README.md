# Add-Shift-to-Calendar

My day job uses a Google Sheet (which I also built) to make the staff schedule.  We work multiple shifts each schedule so my day to day isn't always consistent. In order to help my wife know when I'm working and what time my shifts are, I would manually enter them into a shared Google Calendar. Now, this add-on handles everything for me. 

The spreadsheet itself may not make any sense to you but hopefully the comments in the code will help you understand it enough to apply it to your needs.
